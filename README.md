### ðŸ§­ About Me

Dedicated to advancing the intersection of cognitive science and social robotics, I design systems that empower machines to interact with the world in intuitive, adaptive, and human-centric ways.  
My work optimizes how robots process, retain, and utilize information, ensuring their decision-making aligns with dynamic real-world demands.  
With an interdisciplinary approach, I aim to create robots that seamlessly integrate into human ecosystems â€” fostering technology thatâ€™s both intelligent and intuitively aligned with human needs.
