### ðŸŽ“ MSc Robotics Engineering  
**ðŸ¤– Focus:** Cognitive Robotics & AI

Iâ€™m all about bridging cognitive science and roboticsâ€”where machines go beyond data-crunching to learn, sense, and collaborate in real-time. My work revolves around building systems that:

- **Continuously learn** and adapt on the fly  
- **Store and recall** information with ease  
- **Interact naturally** with people and their environment  

I love watching these systems evolve. Every improvement proves we're not just making tools, but **true collaborators**. My ultimate goal is a future where robots fit seamlessly into daily life, strengthening our routines and relationships by growing **alongside us**, rather than just for us.
