### ðŸŽ“ MSc Robotics Engineering  
**ðŸ¤– Focus:** Machine Learning â€¢ Cognitive Architecture Design

I'm an MSc Robotics engineer primarily focused on machine learning and deeply interested in designing cognitive architectures. My expertise lies in developing intelligent systems that allow robots to perceive, learn from experience, and adapt naturally to their environments. My ultimate goal is a future where robots fit seamlessly into daily life, strengthening our routines and relationships by growing **alongside us**, rather than just for us.
